          <h2 id="post-artist">Post an artist</h2>
          <p>
            You can post an artist by adding all parameters: artistName, genre,
            image, description, and albums. It is possible to post without an
            image, but note that it's not recommended. Id is auto-incremented by
            default, and can be left at 0.
          </p>

          <div class="method__container">
            <p class="method__paragraph">

          <h2 id="put-artist">Update an artist</h2>
          <p>
            You can update an artist by altering the parameters you want to
            change. You won't be able to alter the id as it is auto-incremented
            in the database, but artist name, genre, image, description, and
            albums can be changed.
          </p>

          <div class="method__container">
            <p class="method__paragraph">
